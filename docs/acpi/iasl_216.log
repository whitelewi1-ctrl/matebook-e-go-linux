 iASL Warning: There were 2 external control methods found during
 disassembly, but only 0 were resolved (2 unresolved). Additional
 ACPI tables may be required to properly disassemble the code. This
 resulting disassembler output file may not compile because the
 disassembler did not know how many arguments to assign to the
 unresolved methods. Note: SSDTs can be dynamically loaded at
 runtime and may or may not be available via the host OS.

 To specify the tables needed to resolve external control method
 references, the -e option can be used to specify the filenames.
 Example iASL invocations:
     iasl -e ssdt1.aml ssdt2.aml ssdt3.aml -d dsdt.aml
     iasl -e dsdt.aml ssdt2.aml -d ssdt1.aml
     iasl -e ssdt*.aml -d dsdt.aml

 In addition, the -fe option can be used to specify a file containing
 control method external declarations with the associated method
 argument counts. Each line of the file must be of the form:
     External (<method pathname>, MethodObj, <argument count>)
 Invocation:
     iasl -fe refs.txt -d dsdt.aml
